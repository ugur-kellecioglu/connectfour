The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 
Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.


A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their 
yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. 
The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, 
until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. 
If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.
